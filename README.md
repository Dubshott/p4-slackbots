## Objectives

#Midterm: 1 v 1 game working

- We want our main game to start working by this time. There should be at least three pokemon to choose from. The opponent will most likely be a bot, so we will try to have a random move selector for the game to work. 

#N@TM : Additional Features
- We add on to the main game with other features like a leaderboard and more back end to it. 
- We would also want to create a leaderboard by calculating how far the player gets in the battle tree. 

#Collegeboard: Final Touches

- Add as many pokemons and features as we can and make sure there are no bugs or anything. We can even try to make it so people can choose any pokemon they want out of all 898 pokemon.
