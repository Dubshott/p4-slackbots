## User Guides
1. You will enter the website on the homepage
2. Press which place you want to enter in the navigation bar
3. You can press either Pokedex or Pokemon Game to see the main project or click the minilab-storage to see individual projects. 

### Pokedex
1. When you press on the pokedex, you will see 898 pokemon in a list. This gives the picture of the pokemon as well as the Pokemon's name
2. If you press on a specific pokemon, you will be able to see the picture, name, type, height, and weight of the pokemon
3. This works for every single pokemon in the pokedex

## Objectives

Midterm: 1 v 1 game working

- We want our main game to start working by this time. There should be at least three pokemon to choose from. The opponent will most likely be a bot, so we will try to have a random move selector for the game to work. 
- We will also have a stroy mode as a imtegral part of the game where there will be gym battles as well. 

N@TM : Additional Features
- We add on to the main game with other features like a leaderboard and more back end to it. 
- We would also want to create a leaderboard by calculating how far the player gets in the battle tree. 

 Final Touches
- Add as many pokemons and features as we can and make sure there are no bugs or anything. We can even try to make it so people can choose any pokemon they want out of all 898 pokemon.
